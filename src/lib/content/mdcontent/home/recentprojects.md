Generally, I've been working quite a bit with <b class="text-orange-400">Rust</b> and <b class="text-blue-300">Typescript</b>. 
My focus has been on building useful web applications to 
solve business problems or to make it easier for people to be creative.
One day, I think i'd like to make a game. But right now, I want to be practical
and make things people might actually be interested in using.
